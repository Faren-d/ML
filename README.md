# 3 main Types of Machine Learning

## Supervised Learning

- In this type of machine learning, algorithms learn from labeled data, meaning that the data includes both input features and their corresponding output labels.

- The goal of the algorithm is to find a function that accurately maps inputs to the correct outputs, enabling it to make predictions on new data that the algorithm has not seen before.

- This type of learning is commonly used for regression and classification tasks.

- Supervised Learning algorithms can learn complex relationships between input features and output labels.

- The models trained by Supervised Learning can make accurate predictions on new data.

- Supervised Learning is well-suited for situations where labeled data is readily available.
Unsupervised Learning

## Unsupervised Learning

- This involves training algorithms on unlabeled data, which means the data only includes input features without any corresponding output labels.

- The goal of these algorithms is to uncover hidden patterns, structures, or relationships within the data.

- This type of learning is frequently employed in tasks like clustering and dimensionality reduction.

- Unsupervised Learning is capable of identifying hidden patterns and structures in data without the need for labeled examples.

- It is a valuable tool for exploratory data analysis and gaining insights into the underlying structure of data.

- Unsupervised Learning is particularly useful when labeled data is scarce or expensive to obtain.

  
## Reinforcement Learning

- Reinforcement learning involves training an agent to interact with an environment.

- The agent learns by taking actions within the environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.

- The ultimate goal is for the agent to learn a policy that maximizes the cumulative reward it receives over time.

- Reinforcement learning is widely used in areas like game playing, robotics, and sequential decision-making.

- A good example of reinforcement learning is the classic video game, Super Mario.

- In the game, the player (Mario) is rewarded for positive actions like collecting coins and completing levels, and penalized for negative actions, like falling into pits or getting hit by enemies.

- This reward-and-penalty system encourages the player to learn from their mistakes, improve their strategies, and adapt their gameplay to get the most rewards with the fewest penalties.

- As the player progresses through the game, they continuously learn and enhance their skills based on the feedback they receive.

- Reinforcement Learning empowers an agent to learn from its own experiences and interactions with the environment.

- It excels in handling sequential decision-making problems and adapting to changing environments.

- Reinforcement Learning has the potential to lead to the discovery of novel and optimal strategies.

These types of machine learning are not mutually exclusive and can sometimes be used in conjunction with one another to solve problems
