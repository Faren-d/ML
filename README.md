# 3 main Types of Machine Learning

![types-of-ml](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e5feecce-9fd3-4b28-a535-094cf388de2d)


## Supervised Learning

- In this type of machine learning, algorithms learn from labeled data, meaning that the data includes both input features and their corresponding output labels.

- The goal of the algorithm is to find a function that accurately maps inputs to the correct outputs, enabling it to make predictions on new data that the algorithm has not seen before.

- This type of learning is commonly used for regression and classification tasks.

- Supervised Learning algorithms can learn complex relationships between input features and output labels.

- The models trained by Supervised Learning can make accurate predictions on new data.

- Supervised Learning is well-suited for situations where labeled data is readily available.
Unsupervised Learning

Here are some common types of algorithms used in supervised learning:

#### Regression Algorithms:

- Linear Regression

- Polynomial Regression

- Ridge Regression

- Lasso Regression

#### Classification Algorithms:

- Logistic Regression

- Decision Trees

- Random Forests

- Support Vector Machines (SVM)

- Naive Bayes

- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)



## Unsupervised Learning

- This involves training algorithms on unlabeled data, which means the data only includes input features without any corresponding output labels.

- The goal of these algorithms is to uncover hidden patterns, structures, or relationships within the data.

- This type of learning is frequently employed in tasks like clustering and dimensionality reduction.

- Unsupervised Learning is capable of identifying hidden patterns and structures in data without the need for labeled examples.

- It is a valuable tool for exploratory data analysis and gaining insights into the underlying structure of data.

- Unsupervised Learning is particularly useful when labeled data is scarce or expensive to obtain.

Here are common types of unsupervised learning algorithms:

#### Clustering Algorithms:

- K-means Clustering

- Hierarchical Clustering

- DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)
‚óè
#### Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms:

- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

- t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)

- Autoencoders


  
## Reinforcement Learning

- Reinforcement learning involves training an agent to interact with an environment.


![reinforcement-learning](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/17c8de2a-6472-42e4-bccd-96f63dd1929f)

- The agent learns by taking actions within the environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.

- The ultimate goal is for the agent to learn a policy that maximizes the cumulative reward it receives over time.

- Reinforcement learning is widely used in areas like game playing, robotics, and sequential decision-making.

- A good example of reinforcement learning is the classic video game, Super Mario.

- In the game, the player (Mario) is rewarded for positive actions like collecting coins and completing levels, and penalized for negative actions, like falling into pits or getting hit by enemies.

- This reward-and-penalty system encourages the player to learn from their mistakes, improve their strategies, and adapt their gameplay to get the most rewards with the fewest penalties.

- As the player progresses through the game, they continuously learn and enhance their skills based on the feedback they receive.

- Reinforcement Learning empowers an agent to learn from its own experiences and interactions with the environment.

- It excels in handling sequential decision-making problems and adapting to changing environments.

- Reinforcement Learning has the potential to lead to the discovery of novel and optimal strategies.

Here are common types of reinforcement learning algorithms:

#### Value-Based Methods:

- Q-Learning

- SARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action)

- Deep Q-Networks (DQN)

#### Policy-Based Methods:

- Policy Gradient

- REINFORCE

#### Actor-Critic Methods

These types of machine learning are not mutually exclusive and can sometimes be used in conjunction with one another to solve problems
